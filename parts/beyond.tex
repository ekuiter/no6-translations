\mypart{Beyond}{
	One rare, peaceful day in the West Block --- Shion, who chose to remain in No. 6 after its destruction --- Nezumi, who wanders like the wind. And finally, the secret of Shion's father. Vivid fragments are cut out from the lives of each, instilling spirit back into the story whose end was a sore parting for many.
}{
	I have not forgotten about them.\\
	The chronicle of their lives is perhaps\\
	the only one worth telling.
	\mybreak
	Could we fully believe in people again?
