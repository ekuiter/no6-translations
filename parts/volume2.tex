\mypart{Volume II}{
	It is 2017. After being chased from No. 6, sixteen-year-old Shion sees the outside world, and its reality, for the first time. \emph{What was it that I thought I knew? What have I been seeing all this time?} Shion strives to live through every day he spends with Nezumi, but he is confronted with a fateful question― "Me, or No. 6 ― which one do you choose?" Fate accelerates, and bears down upon the two.
