% We want the total number of real pages (sheets) to be a multiple of 4, and we
% want the colophon to land on the last page (which will necessarily be an even
% page). So we might need to insert up to 3 blank pages before the colophon.
% First we calculate the current page number modulo 4:
\clearpage
\makeatletter
\count@=\c@sheetsequence%
\@tempcnta=\count@
\divide\@tempcnta by 4
\multiply\@tempcnta by 4
\count@=\numexpr\count@-\@tempcnta\relax
\ifnum\count@>0
\pagestyle{empty}
\loop\ifnum\count@<4
\null\clearpage
\advance\count@\@ne
\repeat
\fi
\makeatother

% Now the current page is a multiple of 4. We put the colophon here.
